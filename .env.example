# Deployment Private Key (DO NOT use real private keys here - this is just a template)
# For Anvil testing, use one of the test private keys provided by Anvil
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80

# Anvil Local Network Configuration
ANVIL_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
CHAIN_ID=31337

# Etherscan API Key (for contract verification on real networks)
# Leave empty for local Anvil testing
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here

# Token Configuration
# Total supply of tokens (in smallest unit, considering decimals)
# Example: 1000000 tokens with 18 decimals = 1000000000000000000000000
INITIAL_SUPPLY=1000000000000000000000000

# Airdrop amount per recipient (in smallest unit, considering decimals)
# Example: 100 tokens with 18 decimals = 100000000000000000000
AIRDROP_AMOUNT=100000000000000000000

# Token Details

## Step 4: Understand Each Variable

Let me break down what each line means:

**PRIVATE_KEY:**
- This is the private key used to deploy contracts
- The example key shown is Anvil's first test account (it's public and safe to use for testing)
- Never put a real private key with actual funds here in .env.example

**ANVIL_RPC_URL:**
- The URL where your Anvil blockchain is running
- Standard Anvil address is http://127.0.0.1:8545
- You can also use http://localhost:8545 (they're the same)

**CHAIN_ID:**
- Identifies which blockchain network you're on
- Anvil's default chain ID is 31337
- Ethereum mainnet is 1, testnets have different IDs

**ETHERSCAN_API_KEY:**
- Used for verifying contracts on Etherscan
- Not needed for Anvil local testing
- You'd get this from Etherscan.io if deploying to real networks

**INITIAL_SUPPLY:**
- Total number of tokens that will exist
- Written in the smallest unit (Wei equivalent for tokens)
- If you want 1 million tokens with 18 decimals, you need to add 18 zeros

**AIRDROP_AMOUNT:**
- How many tokens each airdrop recipient gets
- Also in smallest unit with decimals
- Example shows 100 tokens with 18 decimals

## Step 5: Save the .env.example File
- Save the file in your code editor
- Make sure it's saved in the project root directory
- Verify the filename is exactly ".env.example"

## Step 6: Create Your Actual .env File
- Now create another file called ".env" (without "example")
- Copy everything from .env.example into .env
- This .env file is where you'll put your actual values
- For now, you can leave the values the same since we're using Anvil test accounts

## Step 7: Verify Your .gitignore
- Open your .gitignore file
- Look for a line that says ".env"
- If it's not there, add this line:
```
.env
```
- This ensures your actual .env file (with potentially sensitive data) never gets committed to Git
- Note: .env.example SHOULD be committed to Git, only .env should be ignored

## Step 8: Understanding the Difference
**Why two files?**
- **.env.example** = Template that gets committed to Git, shows what variables are needed
- **.env** = Your actual configuration with real values, NEVER committed to Git

## Step 9: Test Your Setup (Optional)
If you want to verify your environment variables work:
- You can create a simple test script that reads these variables
- We'll do this properly when we write deployment scripts
- For now, just having the files created is enough

## Your File Structure Should Now Look Like:
```
erc20-airdrop-token/
├── .env.example          ← Template (commit this)
├── .env                  ← Actual config (DON'T commit this)
├── .gitignore           ← Should include .env
